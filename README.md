# 327FinalProject
The project is almost working. The only problem is that values for the member variables for each thread are not saved.
That means that every time you enter the name of a function, it will always return the first value.
For example, nextPrime will always return 2 because 2 is never saved to lastPrime like it's supposed to.
This is the only problem that needs to be fixed.
